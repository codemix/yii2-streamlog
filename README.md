A Yii 2 log target for streams in URL format.

This log target allows you to log to any of the URL like targets that are
[supported by PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php). Typical use cases
are docker containers that often log to `STDOUT` and `STDERR`, in which case
the target urls would be `php://stdout` and `php://stderr` respectively.

It's also possible to use an already opened resource or one of PHP's
[predefined resource constants](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.io-streams.php)
(only available in CLI context). See the `$fp` option below.


## Installation and Configuration

Install the package through [composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    composer require codemix/yii2-streamlog

And then add this to your application configuration:

```php
<?php
return [
    // ...
    'components' => [
        // ...
        'log' => [
            'targets' => [
                [
                    'class' => 'codemix\streamlog\Target',
                    'url' => 'php://stdout',
                    'levels' => ['info','trace'],
                    'logVars' => [],
                ],
                [
                    'class' => 'codemix\streamlog\Target',
                    'url' => 'php://stderr',
                    'levels' => ['error', 'warning'],
                    'logVars' => [],
                ],
            ],
        ],
```

## Configuration Options

 * (*string*) `$url` the URL to use. See http://php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php for details.
   This gets ignored if `$fp` is configured.
 * (*resource*) `$fp` an open and writeable resource. This can also be one of
   PHP's predefined resources like `STDOUT` or `STDERR`, which are available in CLI context.
   (Since 1.2.0)
 * (*string|null*) `$replaceNewline` a string that should replace all newline characters in a log message.
   Default ist `null` for no replacement. (Since 1.1.0)
 * (*string|null*) `$replaceParagraph` a string that should replace all paragraph characters in a log message.
   Default ist `null` for no replacement.
 * (*bool*) `$disableTimestamp` whether to omit the timestamp prefix. The default is `false` which
   will prepend every message with a timestamp generated by `yii\log\Target::getTime()`. (Since 1.3.0)
 * (*string*) `$prefixString` a string that will be prefixed to every message at the first position
   (even before the timestamp - if not disabled). Default is an empty string. (Since 1.3.0)
